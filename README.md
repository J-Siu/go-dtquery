### Install

Go install

```sh
go install github.com/J-Siu/go-dtquery@latest
```

Download

- https://github.com/J-Siu/go-dtquery/releases

### Usage

#### DQ package

```sh
go get github.com/J-Siu/go-dtquery/dq
```

```go
import "github.com/J-Siu/go-dtquery/dq"
```

See [root.go](/cmd/root.go) for code sample.

#### DT_Url

As Chrome/Chromium name(key) of the devtool url in http//localhost:9222/json/version may change overtime, starting dq v1.2.0, AFTER calling `dq.Get(host, port)`, the devtool url can be access directly with `dq.DT_Url`:

```go
devtools := dq.Get(host, port)
devtool_url := dq.DT_Url()
# # or
# devtool_url := devtools.DT_Url
```

Current support devtools url json name:
- WsUrl (Chrome < 140)
- WebSocketDebuggerUrl (Chrome >= 140)

#### Command Line Demo

1. Close running Chrome. Start Chrome with following option:

    ```sh
    chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222
    ```

    Or Chromium with the same option.

2. Run

    ```sh
    go run main.go [-r <hostname/ip>] [-p <port>]
    ```
